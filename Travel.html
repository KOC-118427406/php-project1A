        <h1>Travel</h1>
        <div><p>From a very young age I have been very eager to travel the world and I am lucky enough to have travelled to various countries throughout my childhood. 
                One of my favourite places to travel has been Paris, France. I am lucky enough to have seen many of the tourist attractions in Paris, including
            <ul>
                <li>The Eiffel Tower</li>
                <li>The Arc De Triomphe</li>
                <li>Disneyland</li>
            </ul>

                <br>
                <p>I am lucky enough to have travelled to Dublin on numerous occasions and I have attended many concerts in venues such as The 02 and The 3 Arena in Dublin. <br>
                Although I have travelled far and wide to counties such as England, Wales, France, Spain and Portugal, my best memories would have to be travelling to various music festivals in Ireland. <br>
                I would definitely like to move to Australia when I am older for a few years. <br>
            </p>
            <p>In the last number of years I have been to many Music Festivals including Indiependence, Longitude and Electric Picnic. <br>
                Although these festivals are all in Ireland, the atmosphere is second to none. 
                I have been lucky enough to see many world class acts including Drake, Macklemore and The Sript right on my doorstep.</p>
